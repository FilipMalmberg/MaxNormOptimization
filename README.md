# MaxNormOptimization
This is a C++ implementation of the algorithm for max-norm optimal binary labeling of graphs, described in the following paper:

- [Malmberg, Filip, and Alexandre X. Falcão. "A Practical Algorithm for Max-Norm Optimal Binary Labeling of Graphs." arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.12642 (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12642) 

## Usage
To use the code in a C++ project, simply include the following files in your project:

- Atom.h
- Implication.h
- MaxNormOptimization.h
- ObjectiveFuntion.h
- Selection.h
- Typedefs.h
- MaxNormOptimization.cpp
- ObjectiveFunction.cpp
- Selection.cpp

An example of how to construct an objective function and solve the resulting labeling problem is given in "main.cpp".
